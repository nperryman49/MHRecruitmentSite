	<h2>Business Resource Groups</h2>
	<p>Employee Business Resource Groups (EBRGs) are voluntary, employee-led groups that come together around common interests to support each other and provide education and awareness as well as networking, professional development and other opportunities.

		EBRGs help MetroHealth build relationships with social, cultural and other groups of people who make up our community.
		
		They provide opportunities for MetroHealth to share its values of Service to Others, Teamwork, Accountability, Respect, Inclusion and Diversity, and a Quest for Excellence.
		
		And they are one of the many ways MetroHealth celebrates diversity, provides a warm, welcoming environment to employees of all backgrounds and fosters their professional and personal success.</p>
		<p>Current MetroHealth's EBRGs include:</p>
